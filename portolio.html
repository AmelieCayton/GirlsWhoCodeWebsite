	San Franciscan born and raised, the cultures that run through the city run through my blood.
	Often being seen either on the stage, in the library, or in the courtroom <em> (for mock trial) </em>  you will always see me with a smile ready to help where I can.
	Being a filipina-american I grew up in a huge family that has become my constant and my culture that lives in my heart and soul.
	Foodie at heart but not looking for the fancy or hipster meet ups, but rather the food that feels like home.

	 I live in four worlds; one based off the books that I've read and listened to ranging from Hans Christian Andersen to Stephen King.
	 Another world is filled with music that you can feel from the tip of your fingertips and beat to the sound of your heart.
	 The next world follows the adventures set from different Marvel Characters and Disney/Pixar movies that has me dreaming for a character that looks like me.
	 Finally the real world, a world filled with science and a mixture of all three of my other worlds, and in this world I'm able to put what I learned in each three to work.
